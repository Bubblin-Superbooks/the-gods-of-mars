The sight of them in the open brought a score of fliers darting toward us from all directions.</p><p>The therns fired upon them through shields affixed to their rifles, but on, steadily on, came the grim, black craft. They were small fliers for the most part, built for two to three men. A few larger ones there were, but these kept high aloft dropping bombs upon the temples from their keel batteries.</p></div> </div>

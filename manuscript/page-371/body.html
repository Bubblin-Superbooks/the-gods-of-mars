His companions had returned here, and we now overheard a portion of their conversation.</p><p>"What can be detaining Tan Gama?" asked one.</p><p>"He certainly could not be all this time fetching his shortsword from the Thark's cell," spoke another.</p><p>"His short-sword?" asked a woman. "What mean you?"</p><p>"Tan Gama left his short-sword in the Thark's cell," explained the first speaker, "and left us at the runway, to return and get it."</p><p>"Tan Gama wore no short-sword this night," said the woman. "It was broken in to-day's battle with the Thark, and Tan Gama gave it to me to repair. See, I have it here," and as she spoke she drew Tan Gama's short-sword from beneath her sleeping silks and furs.</p><p>The warriors sprang to their feet.</p></div> </div>

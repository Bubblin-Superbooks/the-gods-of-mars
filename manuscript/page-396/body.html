His attitude was cold, haughty, and uncompromising.</p><p>"Kaor, Zat Arras," I said in greeting, but he did not respond.</p><p>"Why were these prisoners not disarmed?" he asked to Kantos Kan.</p><p>"They are not prisoners, Zat Arras," replied the officer.</p><p>"Two of them are of Helium's noblest family. Tars Tarkas, Jeddak of Thark, is Tardos Mors' best beloved ally. The other is a friend and companion of the Prince of Heliumâ€”that is enough for me to know."</p></div> </div>

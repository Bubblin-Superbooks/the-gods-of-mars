That, in the presence of many men of Helium he has blasphemed against the Sacred Iss, and against the Valley Dor, and the Lost Sea of Korus, and the Holy Therns themselves, and even against Issus, Goddess of Death, and of Life Eternal. And know you further by witness of thine own eyes that see him here now upon the Pedestal of Truth that he has indeed returned from these sacred precincts in the face of our ancient customs, and in violation of the sanctity of our ancient religion.</p><p>"He who be once dead may not live again. He who attempts it must be made dead for ever. Judges, your duty lies plain before youâ€”here can be no testimony in contravention of truth. What reward shall be meted to John Carter in accordance with the acts he has committed?"</p></div> </div>

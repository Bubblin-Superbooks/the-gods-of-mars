<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">and in its shiny surface I saw pictured a sight that caused me to whisper:</p><p>"Move not, Tars Tarkas! Move not a muscle!"</p><p>He did not ask why, but stood like a graven image while my eyes watched the strange thing that meant so much to us.</p><p>What I saw was the quick movement of a section of the wall behind me. It was turning upon pivots, and with it a section of the floor directly in front of it was turning. It was as though you placed a visiting-card upon end on a silver dollar that you had laid flat upon a table, so that the edge of the card perfectly bisected the surface of the coin.</p><p>The card might represent the section of the wall that turned and the silver dollar the section of the floor. Both were so nicely fitted into the adjacent portions of the floor and wall that no crack had been noticeable in the dim light of the chamber.</p></div> </div>
